My practice with Computer Vision

Run the detect.py file in yolo_final

before that get the yolov3.weights file from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

and save in the same directory

Right now it gives terrible fps of around 0.5. Will look to fix that.

If someone else has a fix to the fps issue any help would be appreciated.
